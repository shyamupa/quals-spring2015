\begin{frame}{The Problem}

  \begin{exampleblock}{Example}
      \textbf<2>{The {\color<3->{red} battle}\only<4->{$\implies$ (Battle of Trafalgar)} was the most decisive naval victory of the {\color<3->{red}war}\only<4->{$\implies$ (Napoleanic Wars)}}. The British led by Admiral Lord Nelson defeated the French off the coast of Spain. Nelson succumbed to his injuries in battle.
      \end{exampleblock}
  \end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Motivation}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Event mentions in a text display ambiguity and variability.
    \begin{exampleblock}{Variability}
      {Battle of Waterloo, defeat at Waterloo, campaign of Waterloo, the 1815 battle, Napolean's defeat, French cavalry attack}
    \end{exampleblock}

    \begin{exampleblock}{Ambiguity}
      {\highlightchunk{red}{At the Olympics} in Athens, Greece, Kupets won a silver medal with her fellow U.S. team members in the team all-around competition.}
    \end{exampleblock}
  \item Benefits of grounding - more context available for downstream tasks like event coreference, news aggregation etc.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Benefits to Entity Wikification}
  \begin{block}{Example}
    After the {\color<2>{blue} death of \highlightchunk{red}{Cromwell}}, \highlightchunk{red}{Charles'} chances of regaining the Crown at first seemed slim as Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son, Richard.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Comparison with Entity Wikification}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \emph{Scarcity of training data}: Only 1\% of wikipedia pages are about events.
    %% Number higher if you consider events in subheading of an entity's page (eg. ``Invasion of Russia'' section under the wikipage of \textsc{Napolean}).
  \item Detection of Event Mention
    %% Mentions are not as specific. "Chicago" vs "the civil war".
  %% \item {\color{red}solution:} Dynamic mention expansion.
  \item Non-Trivial Candidate Generation.
    %% is not as trivial as dictionary look-up.
  %% \item {\color{red}solution:} Cascaded filtering.
  \item \textsc{Status:} Current system gets 62\% F1 on events in wikipedia.
  \end{itemize}
