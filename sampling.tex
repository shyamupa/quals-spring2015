\begin{frame}{Key Properties}
  For $G(i) \sim Gumbel(0)$,
  \begin{align*}
    & \argmax_i{G(i)+\phi(i)} \sim \frac{\exp(\phi(x))}{Z}
    & \max_i{G(i)+\phi(i)} \sim Gumbel(\log Z) \tag{Max-Stability from \cite{hazan}}
  \end{align*}

\begin{frame}{Gumbel-Max Trick (Discrete Case)}
Suppose you have a discrete distribution specified by un-normalized log probabilities $\{\phi(i)\}_{i=1}^{k}$, i.e.,
  \begin{align*}
    \Pr(x_i) = \frac{\exp\phi(i)}{\sum_j\exp\phi(j)}
  \end{align*}
  We can draw samples from this distribution using the following procedure.
  \begin{align*}
    & \text{If} \qquad G(i) \sim Gumbel(0) \\
    & \text{then} \qquad x_i \sim \argmax_i \{G(i) +\phi(i)\} 
  \end{align*}
