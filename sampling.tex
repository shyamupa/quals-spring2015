  \begin{itemize}
  \item \begin{align*}  
    %% CDF(x) = \exp \left(-\exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)}{\beta}\right)\right)
    CDF(x) = \exp \left(-\exp\left(-x+\mu\right)\right) \tag{$\mu$ is location parameter}

  %% \item Mean, $t = \mu+\gamma\beta$
  \item Mean = \mu+\gamma$
  %% \item In the remaining discussion, we will consider the form where $\beta=1$ and $\mu = -\gamma$,
  %%   \begin{align*}
  %%     CDF(x) = \exp \left(-\exp\left(-(x+\gamma)\right)\right)
