\begin{frame}{About Me}

\begin{frame}{My Current Research}
Grounding Events to a Knowledge Base
\begin{block}{}
After the {\color{blue} death of \highlightchunk{red}{Cromwell}} in 1658, \highlightchunk{red}{Charles'} chances of regaining the Crown at first seemed slim as Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son, Richard.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Event mentions in a text demonstrate ambiguity and variability just like named-entities.
\begin{exampleblock}{Variability}
%% \begin{multicols}{2}
%% \begin{itemize}
\emph{Battle of Waterloo, defeat at Waterloo, campaign of Waterloo, the 1815 battle, Napolean's defeat, French cavalry attack}
%% \end{itemize}
%% \end{multicols}
\end{exampleblock}
\begin{exampleblock}{Example for Ambiguity}
\emph{\highlightchunk{red}{At the Olympics} in Athens, Greece, Kupets won a silver medal with her fellow U.S. team members in the team all-around competition.}
\end{exampleblock}
\item Benefits of grounding events - more context available for downstream tasks like event coreference, news aggregation etc.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Comparison with Entity Wikification}

\begin{itemize}
\item Only 1\% of wikipedia pages are about events. Number higher if you consider events in subheading of an entity's page (eg. ``Invasion of Russia'' section under the wikipage of \textsc{Napolean}).
\item Candidate generation is not as trivial as dictionary look-up.
\pause
\item {\color{red}solution:} Cascaded filtering.
\pause
\item Mentions are not as specific. "Chicago" vs "the civil war".
\pause
\item {\color{red}solution:} Dynamic context expansion.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
